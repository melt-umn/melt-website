The process for creating an Eclipse plugin for user developed languages is under
development. This page should be understood to document a goal that we are
working towards.

## Setup

New plugins can begin by using the Silver plugin as an example.

```
silver$ cp -r eclipse-plugin/ mylang-plugin/
```

The majority of code that will need to be modified will be under `plugin/src/`.

## Coloring

## Folding

## File Stubs

## Building / Exporting
