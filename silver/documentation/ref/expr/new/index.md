## new

`new` is the inverse operation of `decorate`. See [Decorated vs Undecorated]({{ "/concepts/decorated-vs-undecorated/" | prepend: site.sv_wiki_base }}) for an explanation on what _`Decorated`_ means.

The following syntax will undecorate a decorated tree:

```
new ( <Expr> )
```

The _`Expr`_ is expected to be decorated; the result is the undecorated form.
