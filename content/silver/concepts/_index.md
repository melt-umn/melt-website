Silver extends the notion of attribute grammars with a number of
features not found in Knuth's original 1968 description of them.  Some
of these, such as _forwarding_ are unique to Silver, others such as
higher-order attributes and reference attributes have been pioneered
by others.

These are elaborated in this section.
