[CodeProber](https://codeprober.org/) is a very helpful tool for debugging compilers,
built by Anton Risberg Alak√ºla at Lund University.
It enables one to explore syntax trees and view the values of attributes using a graphical interface.
Installation instructions and demos can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/lu-cs-sde/codeprober).

## Setting up CodeProber with a Silver project
Silver has been adapted to work with CodeProber. All that is required is to define an entry point function
`codeProberParse`, which can be in the same grammar as `main`.
This function should take a `[String]` argument and return an `IO` action of any `Decorated` type.
The file to parse will be provided as the last item in the list, preceded by any extra arguments specified in the interface.
For example:
```
fun codeProberParse IO<Decorated Root> ::= args::[String] = do {
  when_(null(args), fail("Invalid arguments to codeProberParse"));
  let fileName = last(args);
  content <- readFile(fileName);
  let result = parse(content, fileName);
  when_(!result.parseSuccess, fail(result.parseErrors));
  return decorate result.parseTree.ast_Root with {};
};
```
Then the CodeProber server can be launched as
```
java -jar /path/to/codeprober.jar mylang.jar
```
This will print a local URL from which to explore the tree in the browser.
