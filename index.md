# Minnesota Extensible Language Tools

## Research:

Our main research interests are in the declarative specification of programming languages semantics and transformations for optimization. We are specifically interested in techniques that lead to a high degree of modularity in the composition of language specifications. This is so that specifications for language features can be easily combined to create specifications for new languages. We are thus interested in tools that automatically compose and implement such specifications to create pre-processors, compilers and optimizers for the newly specified languages.

## Motivation:

Software development is a time-consuming and error-prone process that often results in unreliable and insecure software. At least part of the reason for these undesirable results is that large semantic gap between the programmer's high-level understanding of the problem and the relatively low-level programming language in which the problem solutions are encoded. Thus, programmers cannot "say what they mean" but must encode their ideas as programming idioms at a lower level of abstraction. This wastes time and is the source of many errors.

A long range goal is to improve the software development process and the quality of the resulting software artifacts by reducing the semantic gap. Extensible languages provide a promising way to achieve this goal. An extensible language can easily be extended with the unique combination of domain-specific language features that raises the level of abstraction to that of the task at hand. The extended language provides the programmer with language constructs, optimizations, and static program analyses to significantly simplify the software development process.
