This is the repository for the [MELT website](http://melt.cs.umn.edu/).
It contains information about our projects and publications, as well as documentation.

## Editing this content

As a prerequisite, you need Ruby installed, as this site is generated with Jekyll.
The following will locally install its own Bundler, Jekyll, and dependencies.

You should be able to work with this locally by running

```
make env
```

followed by

```
make serve
```

This should bring up a local webserver you can connect to to view the rendered site.
This should let you preview changes before committing them.

## Organization

You'll find the basic MELT pages under [`_pages/`](_pages/).

The [Silver](https://github.com/melt-umn/silver) documentation is found under [`silver/`](silver/), with the exception of the top-level description of Silver, which is found under [`_pages/silver.md`](_pages/silver.md).

## How does this work?

A Jekyll collection is pretty much just a grouped pile of files.
We have a special collection we just call `pages`.
You can see that it's configured in `_config.yml`, and all its files appear in `_pages`.
Every file in this collection has a `permalink` set, which tells Jekyll where to put it (instead of the usual organization for a collection.)

Under `_data` is a special file generated by our python script that stores the sidebar menu navigation structure.
Jekyll loads things in this directory as accessible data.

Under `_include` are small snippets of HTML, included from other pages.
Under `_layout` are the "top-level" layouts for each page.
Each file with YAML frontmatter (the `---` stuff) gets processed according to its `layout`.
Under `_sass` are modules that get processed into our CSS file (which is under `assets/`).

We chose the name `_scripts` to stash our shell scripts for working on the site.
The name isn't special except that the underscore means Jekyll ignores it automatically.
