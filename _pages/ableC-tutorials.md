# AbleC Tutorials

We are holding an AbleC tutorial at the ACM Symposium on the
Principles and Practice of Parallel Programming (PPoPP) on Saturday, February
16, 2019.  This tutorial will teach participants how to create
expressive language extensions to the ableC extensible C compiler
framework.   Specifically, it will cover
- how to define new concrete syntax for extensions,
- how to specify abstract syntax and type checking of extension constructs,
- how to overload existing C operators for extension introduced types, and
- how to easily specify the translation from extension cosntructs to their implementation in plain C.

The 4-page tutorial abstract that appears in the PPoPP proceedings can
be found here:

The PPoPP tutorial materials will all be posted here.  This will be a
more structured and complete version of the current ableC tutorials
that can be found here:
